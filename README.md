## Workplace Fatalities

Using Power BI, this project aims to identify a correlation between workplace fatalities and the amount of times each workplace has been inspected for safety; the dataset given for this project includes all 50 states. I have used a wide variety of charts ranging from clustered column charts to line charts to help tell a better story. There are two pages and each page contains two slicers to assist with filtering the visuals to help give a more in-depth view.

## Conclusions
- The states who are on a Federal Program had more fatalities than those who were on a State program.
- The states who are on a State Program had more penalties than those on a Federal Program
- California took the lead for the most injuries/illnesses from both the Federal and State Program
- Wyoming had the least amount of injuries/illnesses from both the Federal and State program
